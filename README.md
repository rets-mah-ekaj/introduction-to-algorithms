1. **1.1-1:** Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires a convex hull.
> Talking about Sorting, in real-world, we see our contact lists to be alphabetically sorted. This is done by the contacts app itself but is done so that one can find a contact easily.
Talking about Convex hull, in real-world, if some of you have observed the magic wand tool of photo editing softwares that identifies the main object and outlines that object with selection tool so that we can do whatever we want with that object.
